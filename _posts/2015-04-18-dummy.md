Although, computers get stronger day by day, time is still precious to all of us. Thus, We need to simplfy our Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as an engiener. 2D Plane Stress and Strain Analysis is a very useful analysis type because of simplicty, speed and accuracy for the suitable model geometries, If the correct definitions are made. Finite Element Method means linear algebra. There is also a very powerful and easy and free [Python][Python] module, right here. It's name is [SymPy][SymPy]. 



I want show you an example that is taken from the compherensive book of  Daryl L. Logan "A First Course in the Finite Element Method".`SymPy` is a very usefull module for calculating the linear algebra.
