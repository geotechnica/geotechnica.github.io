Although, computers get stronger day by day, time is still precious to all of us. Thus, we need to simplify our Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as an engiener. 2D Plane Stress and Strain Analysis is a very useful analysis type because of simplicty, speed and accuracy for the suitable model geometries, If the correct definitions are made. Finite Element Method means linear algebra. There is also a very powerful and easy and free [Python][Python] module, right here. It's name is [SymPy][SymPy]. `SymPy` is a very usefull module for symbolic mathematics and linear algebra.   


I would like to show an example of Daryl L. Logan's comprehensive book **"A First Course in the Finite Element Method"**. A thin plate subjected to the surface traction shown in Figure.1, determine the nodal displacements and the element stresses. The plate thickness t = 1 in, E = 30 10<sup>6</sup> psi and &nu; = 0.30.

In this example, we just calculate nodal displacement with help of `SymPy`. First of all one must import `SymPy` module as a "sym". If you don't have `SymPy` library on your computer, you can install with help of *pip install sympy* command

```python
import sympy as sym
```




First of all, one have to discretize the plate. We disctetize this plate into two elements for simplicity (Figure.2).
