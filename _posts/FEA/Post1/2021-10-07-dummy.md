Although, computers get stronger day by day, time is still precious to all of us. Thus, we need to simplify our Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as an engiener. 2D Plane Stress and Strain Analysis is a very useful analysis type because of simplicty, speed and accuracy for the suitable model geometries, If the correct definitions are made. Finite Element Method means linear algebra. There are so many programme for linear algebra such as Matlab, Mathematica etc. There is also a very powerful and easy and free [Python][Python] module, right here. It's name is [SymPy][SymPy]. `SymPy` is a very usefull module for symbolic mathematics and linear algebra.   


I would like to show an example of Daryl L. Logan's comprehensive book **"A First Course in the Finite Element Method"**. A thin plate subjected to the surface traction shown in Figure.1, determine the nodal displacements and the element stresses. The plate thickness t = 1 in, E = 30.10<sup>6</sup> psi and &nu; = 0.30. Although, writer doesn't indicate type of material, one can understand material type from Young's modulus. Yes, it is steel.

In this example, we just calculate nodal displacement with help of `SymPy`. First of all one must import `SymPy` module as a "sym". If you don't have `SymPy` library on your computer, you can install with help of *`pip install sympy`* command. 

```python
import sympy as sym
```
Also, should have to determine our symbols that we use in calculation. 

```python
Bi, Bn, Bm, gi, gn, gm, eta = sym.symbols("beta_i beta_n beta_m gamma_i gamma_n gamma_m  eta")
```
And we need to assign variable.
```python
E = 30 * (10 ** 6)  # Young Modulus of Steel in terms of psi
v = 0.3  # Poisson Ratio of Steel
t = 1  # Thickness of Section in.
q = 1000  # Pressure psi.
l = 20  # Length of Section in.
b = 10  # Width of Section in.
```

First of all, one have to discretize the plate. We discretize this plate into two elements for simplicity (Figure.2). A distributed load act on element can be concentrated at the nodes by using constant-strain triangle (CST).

<img src="/assets/FEA/Post1/3.png" alt="Figure.2"  align="center" title="Plate after discretization" style="width:300px;height:150px;" />
*<center> <font size="-1"> <b>Figure.2</b> Plate after discretization</font></center>*

```python
A = t * b
F = 0.5 * (q * A)

Nodes = sym.Matrix([[0, 0], [0, b], [l, b], [l, 0]])
Forces = sym.Matrix([F, 0, F, 0])
```
One can create matrix by using sympy as you can see codes given above. Now, we create stiffness matrices of elements that divided.  

\begin{equation}
[k] = t\cdot A\cdot[B]^T \cdot[D]\cdot[B]
\end{equation}

In the famous algebric equation given above, `[B]` is a gradient matrix and `[D]` is a constitutive matrix. `[B]` changes with element size. `[D]` changes with material behaviour and many of things. In this case, we use linear material model for plane stress conditions.   

$$
[D]=\frac{E}{1-v^{2}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & v & 0 \\
v & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1-v}{2}
\end{array}\right]
$$

A is the area of element that divided. We can easly create element from `[Nodes]` and calculate area of element. 
```python
Nodes1 = Nodes[:3, :2]
Area1 = sym.det(Nodes1.col_insert(1, sym.ones(3, 1))) * 0.5

```
Now, ready to create matrix `B` and matrix `D` for element one.
```python
# [B] Matrix
Bi = Nodes1[2, 1] - Nodes1[1, 1]
Bn = Nodes1[1, 1] - Nodes1[0, 1]
Bm = Nodes1[0, 1] - Nodes1[2, 1]
gi = Nodes1[1, 0] - Nodes1[2, 0]
gn = Nodes1[0, 0] - Nodes1[1, 0]
gm = Nodes1[2, 0] - Nodes1[0, 0]

BI = (1 / (2 * Area1)) * sym.Matrix([[Bi, 0], [0, gi], [gi, Bi]])
BN = (1 / (2 * Area1)) * sym.Matrix([[Bn, 0], [0, gn], [gn, Bn]])
BM = (1 / (2 * Area1)) * sym.Matrix([[Bm, 0], [0, gm], [gm, Bm]])

B1 = sym.Matrix([[BI, BN, BM]])

# [D] Matrix
D = (E / (1 - v ** 2)) * sym.Matrix([[1, v, 0], [v, 1, 0], [0, 0, (1 - v) / 2]])
```
As you know, There are several way to create matrix `B`, for instance one can use for loop. But today, I would like to show `SymPy` library abilities and some linear algebric manipulations. Here, we able to create stiffness matrix `[k]`.  

```python
k1 = (t * Area1 * B1.T * D * B1)
```
We can reach matrix dimension with help of `k1.shape`. We have 3 nodes then stiffness matrix dimension is 6x6. Did you realise something? Yes, right. Global stiffness matrix `[K]` must be in 8x8 dimensions because of 4 number key nodes. Now, we arrange our stiffness matrix by adding zero matrix and also rotating the nodes counterclockwise direction.

```python
k1.row_swap(2, 4)
k1.row_swap(3, 5)
k1.col_swap(4, 2)
k1.col_swap(5, 3)
K1 = (k1.row_join(sym.zeros(6, 2))).col_join(sym.zeros(2, 8))
```

We have to same loop for element two to get stiffness matrix.

```python
Nodes2 = Nodes[1:4, :2]
Area2 = sym.det(Nodes2.col_insert(1, sym.ones(3, 1))) * 0.5

# [B] Matrix

Bi = Nodes2[2, 1] - Nodes2[1, 1]
Bm = Nodes2[1, 1] - Nodes2[0, 1]
Bn = Nodes2[0, 1] - Nodes2[2, 1]
gi = Nodes2[1, 0] - Nodes2[2, 0]
gn = Nodes2[0, 0] - Nodes2[1, 0]
gm = Nodes2[2, 0] - Nodes2[0, 0]

BI = (1 / (2 * Area2)) * sym.Matrix([[Bi, 0], [0, gi], [gi, Bi]])
BN = (1 / (2 * Area2)) * sym.Matrix([[Bn, 0], [0, gn], [gn, Bn]])
BM = (1 / (2 * Area2)) * sym.Matrix([[Bm, 0], [0, gm], [gm, Bm]])

B2 = sym.Matrix([[BI, BN, BM]])

# Stifffness Matrix of the Element-2
k2 = (t * Area2 * B2.T * D * B2)

k2.row_swap(2, 4)
k2.row_swap(3, 5)
k2.col_swap(4, 2)
k2.col_swap(5, 3)
K2 = (((k2.row_insert(2, sym.zeros(1, 6))).row_insert(2, sym.zeros(1, 6))).col_insert(2, sym.zeros(8, 1))).col_insert(2,sym.zeros(8,1))                             
```
Now, we can obtain global stiffness matrix of the system by superposing two matrices.
```python
K = (K1 + K2)
```
Finally, we able to obtain deformations on the nodes by equation given below. 

\begin{equation}
\{F\}=[K]\{d\}
\end{equation}

```python
d = ((K[0:4, 0:4]) ** -1) * Forces
sym.pprint(d * (10 ** 6))
```
You can display deformations on the terminal like below.

$$
\left[\begin{array}{r}
609.6 \\
4.2 \\
663.7 \\
104.1
\end{array}\right]
$$

Now it's `ANSYS Mechanical APDL` turn. I tried to create macro file and i use `PLANE42` element to build up the model. As you know, `PLANE42` is old element but it is suitable to use for this question. May one use `PLANE182` element.

As can be seen in macro code given above, I didn't mesh in triangular shape. If i use triangular shape for mesh, ANSYS would be create to node at the middle of the area. That's why I didn't mesh in tria shape. At the end of the analysis, I got some solution given below (Figure.3).

And of course, ANSYS's indispensable animations.

A one-dimensional bar's displacement subjected to tensile force can be calculated by the equation given below.
\begin{equation}
\delta=\frac{P L}{A E}=\frac{(10000) 20}{10\left(30 \times 10^{6}\right)}=670 \times 10^{-6} \text { in }
\end{equation}

This result \\(670 \cdot 10^{-6} \mbox{ in}\\) can be first approximation as book's says, `ANSYS` gives us \\(656\cdot 10^{-6} \mbox{ in}\\) and finally `SymPy`'s calculation  \\(663.70\cdot 10^{-6} \mbox{ in}\\). Indeed, Finite Element Methods are powerfull methods for approximation to exact solution. Note that, FE Methods can be dangerous in the wrong hand. Thus, I strongly recommend Daryl L. Logan's book in order to learn basis of FEA. That's all. I hope meeting in new topics.
