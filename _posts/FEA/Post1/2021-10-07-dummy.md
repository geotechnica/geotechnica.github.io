Although, computers get stronger day by day, time is still precious to all of us. Thus, we need to simplify our Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as an engiener. 2D Plane Stress and Strain Analysis is a very useful analysis type because of simplicty, speed and accuracy for the suitable model geometries, If the correct definitions are made. Finite Element Method means linear algebra. There are so many programme for linear algebra such as Matlab, Mathematica etc. There is also a very powerful and easy and free [Python][Python] module, right here. It's name is [SymPy][SymPy]. `SymPy` is a very usefull module for symbolic mathematics and linear algebra.   


I would like to show an example of Daryl L. Logan's comprehensive book **"A First Course in the Finite Element Method"**. A thin plate subjected to the surface traction shown in Figure.1, determine the nodal displacements and the element stresses. The plate thickness t = 1 in, E = 30.10<sup>6</sup> psi and &nu; = 0.30. Although, writer doesn't indicate type of material, one can understand material type from Young's modulus. Yes, it is steel.

In this example, we just calculate nodal displacement with help of `SymPy`. First of all one must import `SymPy` module as a "sym". If you don't have `SymPy` library on your computer, you can install with help of *`pip install sympy`* command. 

```python
import sympy as sym
```
Also, should have to determine our symbols that we use in calculation. 

```python
Bi, Bn, Bm, gi, gn, gm, eta = sym.symbols("beta_i beta_n beta_m gamma_i gamma_n gamma_m  eta")
```
And we need to assign variable.
```python
E = 30 * (10 ** 6)  # Young Modulus of Steel in terms of psi
v = 0.3  # Poisson Ratio of Steel
t = 1  # Thickness of Section in.
q = 1000  # Pressure psi.
l = 20  # Length of Section in.
b = 10  # Width of Section in.
```

First of all, one have to discretize the plate. We discretize this plate into two elements for simplicity (Figure.2). A distributed load act on element can be concentrated at the nodes by using constant-strain triangle (CST).

*<center> <font size="-1"> <b>Figure.2</b> Plate after discretization</font></center>*

```python
A = t * b
F = 0.5 * (q * A)

Nodes = sym.Matrix([[0, 0], [0, b], [l, b], [l, 0]])
Forces = sym.Matrix([F, 0, F, 0])
```
One can create matrix by using sympy as you can see codes given above. Now, we create stiffness matrices of elements that divided.

\([k] = t\cdot A\cdot[B]^T \cdot[D]\cdot[B] \)

\begin{equation}
[k] = t\cdot A\cdot[B]^T \cdot[D]\cdot[B]
\end{equation}
